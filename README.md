This Project aims to provide descriptive analytics on the top 10 0000 Songs on Spotify from the year 1960 to 2023, using python. I have anlayzed the Track Number , Popularity and Danceability Numbers of the Dataset.

Reflection:
Excel

Analyzing Data using excel was a bit time consuming , as data had to be formatted in a all kinds of ways  before it could be anlayzed. Any error That occured on the Dataset,affected the outcome of the calculations. 
Paying attention was of high importance as any value that is mistyped or missed can affect the result. 
I would sometimes have to make sure that the correct rows are selected ,scrolling through 10 0000 rows of data was not ideal. Excel did give me the fexibility of being able to go back and refractor changes, s
uch as cleaning my data and modifying my  calculations when needed and the changes would apply where applicable.

Python 

Python had higher processing speed in terms of outputing results and also loading data. , however if the code was long, then I  would spend time just debugging and trying to find where the error is. 
Refractoring the loaded data becomes hard  as it changes the whole code and I would need to start my coding from scratch in order to match up the data with the code . Using arrays really helped and made the work more 
understandable and simple to code.


2.What was different between Python and Excel?

Python needs you to know a lot of coding and comes with some sort of automation while excel is more manual and is slow when processing large datasets.

3.When will you use either of them

I will use python when processing big data or large amount of data and need more insight on data anlysis, and excel for small basic visualization.
Excel is user friendly and provides a GUI ,and therefore would use it for simple takss and anaylysing small amount of data.Excel is a good place to start when doing data anayltics to get me familiar with the funtions and calculations I need to use, While python is more complex and is not user-friendly . Python helps automate repetive tasks and can process  large data all at time .

4.If you could do this assignment over what would you do differently? What are the gaps in your programming or stats knowledge?

I think I would  add more interpretation to my data, by explaining what the results gathered from my data mean.Structure my data in a more meaningful way and provide more insights.With regards to gaps in my programming and stats, I would've relly wanted to explore on more statistcal calcluationsto use for my data. I think Learning python and how to implement and automate will help me understand what  I need to anaylze and report on.
